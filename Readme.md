This is a simple cli tool that lets you read your twitch stream via the command line. Obviously this is much more lightweight than running browsers or UI.

You need [dotnet core](https://dot.net) installed to compile this. I have provided a Rakefile (which is ran with ruby) to also compile out the app.


This will work on Windows/Mac/Linux
